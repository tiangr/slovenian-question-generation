# Natural language processing course 2023/24: `Cross-Lingual Question Generation (Project 3)`

## Overview
This project focuses on expanding the capabilities of the Doc2Query approach by utilizing a T5 model. The primary objective is to explore the model's effectiveness and the quality of questions generated across different languages, identifying both the challenges and opportunities that arise when applying such models in a cross-linguistic context. As a specific case study, the project will involve fine-tuning the system on Slovenian datasets to evaluate its performance and output quality in a less commonly used language setting.
